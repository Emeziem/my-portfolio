					<dt>Brain Teaser Android App &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-brain"></i></dt>
					<dd>
						Brain Teaser is my first major personal project I developed in 2018 using Java programming language. Brain Teaser is a trivia based
						game that test the player's general knowledge on history, politics, fun-facts, country, games, achievements and so much more. It 
						also has a Google leaderboard implemented inside the app and currently runs from android üç≠ 5.0 to android ü•ß 9.0. My app earned more than
						a hundred downloads in the first week of release. <br/>

					<dt>Baseball Guessing Game &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-baseball-ball"></i></dt>
					<dd>
						This project is one of my school final semester project that I had to develop in my Programming II class in the Summer of 2020. The 
						programming language I used for the development of this project was C++. The Baseball Guessing Game is about a player guessing three 
						different numbers and then the computer checks if the player guessed all the three digits that is same with the guess of computer and 
						and awards a <b>strike</b> to the player. Otherwise if all the three are not correct but some are, the the player gets the a strike and balls.
						<br/>
						<em>
							I later learned how to create a Baseball Guessing Game using Java GUI and Model View Controller (MVC) in my Object Oriented Software
							Construct and Design class which was purely based on Java programming language.
						</em>
					</dd>
					<dt>Hangman Game/Word Guess Game &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i></dt>
					<dd>
						This is another school project that was first designed alongside my Baseball Guessing Game in the Summer of 2020. Hangman Game is a popular
						game in the United States of America I was introduced to in my freshman year and I eventually had to do it as a final project in my Programming II 
						class (C++). Hangman Game is all about the player trying to guess a word by guessing each character in the word and if they fail the guess, their 
						health level decreases till they fail completely.
						<br/>
						<em>
							I later redesigned this game in the Fall of 2020 for my Object Oriented Software Construct and Design class using Java GUI and MVC structures.
						</em> 
					</dd>
					<dt>Snake Game &nbsp;<i class="fad fa-snake"></i></dt>
					<dd>
						This project was developed using Java GUI, MVC structures, Object Oriented Programming concepts, and Design Patterns 
						(State and Observer Patterns) in the Fall of 2020.
					</dd>
					<dt>Enhanced Space Invader Game &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-space-shuttle"></i></dt>
					<dd>
						This was the final project in my Object Oriented Software Construct and Design class. It was designed using Java GUI, Object Oriented Programming concepts, 
						Software Design Patterns (Obsever, State, Builder Patterns). Basically the player is to shoot down aliens before it reaches the end of the game board and 
						also avoid the UFO's bombs. <br/>
						<em>
							I implemented over 7 creative ideas inside this project to make it enhanced.
