          I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Software Engineering. I am a Nigerian and before I 
          left my country, I developed and launched my first android application on the Google Play
          Store named <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emeziem.brainteaser&hl=en">Brain Teaser</a>.

      <h2>My Personal Development.</h2>
      <p>
          Here in the United States of America, I have worked on numerous individual school projects in C++
          and Java programming language. Let me start with C++. In the Summer of 2020, I designed a Hangman
          Game and a Baseball Guessing Game with a mini-score board. I earned a full credit for it at the end
          of the semester. In the Fall of 2020, I designed an enhanced Hangman Game using Java GUI, and MVC
          structures. I also learned how to design a Snake Game and Space Invader Game. As my final semster project,
          I successfully designed an Enhanced Space Invader Game using Java GUI, MVC structures, Inheritance, and 
          Design Patterns and I earned an A+ in the class after the semster.
